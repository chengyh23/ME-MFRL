-- Background
An evader is being pursuited by N pursuers (N=3) within a square area. 
The evader will run away when pursuers approach it. 
The goal is to decide the reward for reinforcement learning so that the algorithm for pursuers learns how to capture the evader as soon as possible. 
State space: [-1,1] x [-1,1]. Each agent locates in the square area, its position is represented by two floats as [x, y]. 
Please provide the reward (scoring function) for the given configuration of pursuers and evader.

-- Input format
\input: [position_pursuer_0, position_pursuer_1, position_pursuer_2], [position_evader]
(Note: input should start with string "\input: ", and then provide the position of pursuers and the evader.)

-- Output format
\output: reward
(Note: output should start with string "\output: ", and then provide a float number rewarding pursuers' current states given the evader's state. 
The value can be interpreted as evaluating pursuers' current potential of capturing the evader. The higher the potential, the greater the output value should be.)

-- Example
    -- my input:
    \input: [[-0.5, 0.5], [-0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.0]], [0.0, 0.0]
    -- your output:
    \output: 2.0
