-- Background
An evader is being pursuited by N pursuers (N=3) within a square area. 
The evader will run away when pursuers approach it. 
The goal is to decide pursuers' actions so that they can capture the evader as soon as possible. 
State space: [-1,1] x [-1,1]. Each agent locates in the square area, its position is represented by two floats as [x, y]. 
Action space: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The pursuer's action is discretized into five options: {0: (0, 0), 1: (-1, 0), 2: (+1, 0), 3: (0, -1), 4: (0, +1)}. Each pursuer's action is represented by an interger.
Please provide the optimal action (direction) for all the pursuers.

-- Input format
\input: [position_pursuer_0, position_pursuer_1, position_pursuer_2], [position_evader]
(Note: input should start with string "\input: ", and then provide the position of pursuers and the evader

-- Output format
\output: [action_pursuer_0, action_pursuer_1, action_pursuer_2]
(Note: output should start with string "\output: ", and then provide the discrete action of each pursuer

-- Example
    -- my input:
    \input: [[-0.5, 0.5], [-0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.0]], [0.0, 0.0]
    -- your output:
    \output: [2, 4, 1]
